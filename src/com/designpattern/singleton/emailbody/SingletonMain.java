/*
Purpose:
The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. 
This is particularly useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

Structure:
Private Constructor: Prevents the creation of new instances from outside the class.
Static Variable: Holds the single instance of the class.
Public Static Method: Provides access to the instance.


Singleton Pattern - Use Cases
The Singleton pattern is commonly used in situations where you need a single point of control over 
some resource or service in your application. Here are some typical use cases:

1.Configuration Manager:
Scenario: In many applications, you have a configuration manager that reads settings from a file or 
environment variables. You don’t want multiple instances of this class as it could lead to 
inconsistent configurations.
Solution: Use the Singleton pattern to ensure there’s only one instance of the configuration manager, 
providing a centralized access point for configuration settings.

2.Logging Service:
Scenario: Logging is a critical part of most applications. You want to ensure that all parts of the 
application log messages consistently through a single instance.
Solution: Implement a logging service as a Singleton to ensure that all parts of the application 
use the same logger instance.

3.Database Connection Pool:
Scenario: Managing database connections efficiently is crucial for performance. You want to ensure that 
there’s a single instance managing the pool of database connections.
Solution: The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the connection pool exists, 
which is shared across different parts of the application.

4.Caching:
Scenario: You may have a caching mechanism where certain results or objects are stored in memory to 
speed up retrieval times.
Solution: Implement the cache as a Singleton to avoid creating multiple caches, which would defeat 
the purpose of caching.

5.Thread Pool:
Scenario: In a multi-threaded application, managing threads efficiently is important. You need a 
single pool of threads that can be reused across different tasks.
Solution: The Singleton pattern can ensure there is only one thread pool that manages threads 
throughout the application, optimizing resource usage.
